## Core Principles

- Never use emojis.

## Commit Authorship

When committing code changes:
- Never add Claude as a commit author.
- Always commit as using the default git settings

## Documentation Style

When creating or updating markdown documentation files:
- **Be extremely concise** - engineers scan, they don't read novels
- **Only include essential information** - what they need to know, not what's possible to explain
- **Prefer examples over prose** - show the pattern, not the theory
- **Assume technical competence** - skip obvious explanations
- **Front-load critical info** - put warnings and key concepts first
- **Delete verbose explanations** - if it takes more than 3 sentences, it's probably too long

Default to 1-2 sentence explanations. Only expand when complexity absolutely requires it.
