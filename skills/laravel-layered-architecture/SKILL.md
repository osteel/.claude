# Laravel Layered Architecture

## Layers (top to bottom)

**Presentation** (`app/Commands/`, `app/Http/`, routes, views)
Handles user interaction. Delegates to application services. Never contains business logic.

**Application** (`app/Services/`)
Orchestrates workflows between presentation, domain, and infrastructure. Translates external input into domain objects. No business rules here -- only coordination.

**Domain** (`domain/src/`)
Core business logic. Separate PSR-4 root, zero framework dependencies. Contains aggregates, value objects, domain services, events, actions, repositories (interfaces only).

**Infrastructure** (`app/Aggregates/`, `app/Repositories/`, `app/Providers/`)
Implements domain interfaces. Framework adapters, persistence, external service integrations. Wires domain contracts to concrete implementations via service providers.

## Dependency Direction

Strict top-down only: Presentation -> Application -> Domain <- Infrastructure.

- Domain depends on nothing. No `use App\...` or `use Illuminate\...` in `domain/src/`.
- Application depends on domain, never on presentation.
- Infrastructure implements domain interfaces (dependency inversion).
- Presentation depends on application services, never directly on domain aggregates.

## Domain Layer Rules

- Lives in `domain/src/` with its own `Domain\` namespace (separate PSR-4 autoload root in composer.json).
- Tests live in `domain/tests/`.
- Internal structure mirrors bounded contexts or aggregate roots: `domain/src/Aggregates/ContextName/`.
- Each aggregate context contains: Actions (commands), Events, Entities, ValueObjects, Services, Repositories (interfaces), Exceptions.
- Value objects are immutable. Enforce invariants in constructors/factory methods.
- Domain services contain logic that doesn't belong to a single aggregate.
- Repository interfaces live in the domain. Implementations live in `app/`.

## Application Layer Rules

- Each service gets its own directory under `app/Services/ServiceName/`.
- Define contracts (interfaces) alongside implementations.
- Adapters for external libraries live here (e.g., `PhpSpreadsheetAdapter`).
- Service-specific exceptions in `Exceptions/` subdirectory.

## When Creating New Code

New business concept or rule -> `domain/src/`. Ask: "Does this exist without Laravel?" If yes, it's domain.

New CLI command or HTTP endpoint -> `app/Commands/` or `app/Http/`. Inject application services, don't touch domain directly.

New external integration (API client, file reader, database) -> `app/Services/` with a contract interface. If the domain needs it, define the interface in `domain/src/` and implement in `app/`.

New aggregate -> Create under `domain/src/Aggregates/Name/` with Actions/, Events/, ValueObjects/, Repositories/ subdirectories. Infrastructure adapters go in `app/Aggregates/Name/`.

## Anti-patterns

- Importing `Illuminate\*` in domain code.
- Business logic in commands, controllers, or service providers.
- Domain objects depending on application services.
- Skipping the application layer (presentation calling domain directly).
- Concrete infrastructure classes in domain signatures (use interfaces).
